# FlashCards
FlashCards is a game that runs on your terminal in a flashcard fashion. It is enabled with 30 "cards" (questions) with three potential answers each.

## Setup
First clone this repo and open your terminal. In the terminal, run the command `node index.js`. Your first question should appear with possible answers. Use your arrow keys to select your answer and press enter to make the selection. It will let you know whether or not your answer was correct, and move you onto the next question. At the end of the deck, you'll receive the percentage of questions you got right!
